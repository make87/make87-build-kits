# make87 Build Kits

## Overview

The make87 Build Kits are the base for building applications on the make87 platform. They provide a set of pre-defined
configurations and templates that can be used to quickly set up and deploy applications.

## Usage

To learn more about how to use Build Kits, please refer to
the [documentation](https://docs.make87.com/guides/application_development/build_kits/reference_build_kits/).
Also review Build Kit-specific instructions inside every Build Kit's directory.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the make87 Build Kits. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Submit a pull request.

Please note that you can always create custom Build Kits in your own Application repository. Proposing completely new
Build Kits to this repository with a PR will lead to a longer review and consideration process due to the fact that
make87 will need to support and maintain them once they are added. If you want to add a new Build Kit, please open an
issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.
